# 📖 Burhan: A Database of Rhetorical Analysis of Similes in the Holy Quran

**برهان: قاعدة بيانات التحليل البلاغي للتشبيه في القرآن الكريم**

---

### 👋 About The Project

**Burhan** is a specialized, open-source digital database focused on collecting and documenting the rhetorical analyses of similes (*Tashbih*) found in the Holy Quran. The project aims to provide a rich and reliable academic resource for researchers, students, and anyone interested in Quranic rhetoric (*Balaagha*) and Arabic eloquence.

The name "Burhan" (برهان) was chosen because it means "proof" or "evidence" in Arabic. This project seeks to present the "proofs" of the Quran's rhetorical inimitability (*I'jaz*) by meticulously analyzing one of its most prominent figures of speech: the simile.

### 🎯 Database Contents

The database contains a collection of detailed rhetorical analyses for selected Quranic verses that include various forms of similes. Each analysis adheres to the principles of classical Arabic rhetoric (*Balaagha*) and systematically covers the following aspects:

1.  **Precise classification of the simile type** (e.g., *Mursal*, *Baleegh*, *Dhimni*, *Tamthili*).
2.  **Identification of the simile's components** (the four pillars):
    - The Compared (*Al-Mushabbah*)
    - The Compared-to (*Al-Mushabbah bihi*)
    - The Tool of Comparison (*Adat al-Tashbih*)
    - The Point of Resemblance (*Wajh al-Shabah*)
3.  **The simile's syntactic position** and its impact on the verse's context.
4.  **Explanation of the rhetorical function** and its purpose (e.g., to magnify, horrify, denigrate).
5.  **Analysis of the aesthetic and illustrative effect** within the Quranic context.
6.  **Elucidation of implicit and connotative meanings**, including symbolic or emotional significance.
7.  **Comparison with similar instances** in the Quran, noting any rhetorical differences.
8.  **Presentation of the views of classical scholars** of rhetoric and exegesis (*Mufassirun*), such as Al-Zamakhshari, Ibn Ashur, Al-Razi, and others.

### 🔧 Data Structure

Currently, the data is stored as plain text files (`.txt`) to ensure easy access and portability.

-   **Naming Convention**: Each file is named after the Surah (chapter) and Ayah (verse) number for easy indexing (e.g., `Al-Baqarah-74.txt`).
-   **Format**: Each file contains the complete rhetorical analysis of the verse, fully formatted with Arabic diacritics (*Tashkeel*) to ensure linguistic precision and readability.

*Example from a file:*
```txt
تَحْلِيلٌ بَلَاغِيٌّ لِلتَّشْبِيهِ فِي قَوْلِهِ تَعَالَى: {نِسَآؤُكُمْ حَرْثٌ لَّكُمْ...} (الْبَقَرَة: 223)
